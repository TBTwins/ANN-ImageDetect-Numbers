# ANN-ImageDetect-Numbers

This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** from scratch in **Python** to detect and classify handwritten numbers.

## Key Features

* ðŸš« **No machine learning libraries** are used â€” the ANN logic (forward pass, activation functions, backpropagation, and weight updates) is implemented manually.
* ðŸ”¢ **Only `NumPy`** is used for mathematical operations.
* ðŸ“‰ **Flattening** is applied to prepare image data for training.
* ðŸŽ¯ The goal is to demonstrate the **fundamentals of neural networks** without relying on high-level frameworks.

## Purpose

This project serves as a learning exercise to understand the core mechanics of how neural networks work internally, step by step, instead of depending on pre-built deep learning libraries.
